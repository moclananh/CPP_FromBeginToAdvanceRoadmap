Like a friend class, a friend function can be granted special access to private and protected members of a class in C++. They are not the member functions of the class but can access and manipulate the private and protected members of that class for they are declared as friends.

A friend function can be:

A global function
A member function of another class

---

Sumz: friend function is able to access members without the need of inheriting the class.
