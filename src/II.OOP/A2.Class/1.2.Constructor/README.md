Constructors are special class members which are called by the compiler every time an object of that class is instantiated. Constructors have the same name as the class and may be defined inside or outside the class definition. There are 3 types of constructors:

Default Constructors
Parameterized Constructors
Copy Constructors
Move Constructor
