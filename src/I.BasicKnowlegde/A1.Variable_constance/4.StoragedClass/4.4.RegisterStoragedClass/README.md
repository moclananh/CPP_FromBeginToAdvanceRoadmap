The register storage class declares register variables using the ‘register’ keyword which has the same functionality as that of the auto variables. The only difference is that the compiler tries to store these variables in the register of the microprocessor if a free register is available. This makes the use of register variables to be much faster than that of the variables stored in the memory during the runtime of the program. If a free register is not available, these are then stored in the memory only.

An important and interesting point to be noted here is that we cannot obtain the address of a register variable using pointers.
