Non-Manipulating Algorithms

sort(first_iterator, last_iterator) – To sort the given vector.
sort(first_iterator, last_iterator, greater<int>()) – To sort the given container/vector in descending order
reverse(first_iterator, last_iterator) – To reverse a vector. ( if ascending -> descending OR if descending -> ascending)
*max_element (first_iterator, last_iterator) – To find the maximum element of a vector.
*min_element (first_iterator, last_iterator) – To find the minimum element of a vector.
accumulate(first_iterator, last_iterator, initial value of sum) – Does the summation of vector elements
