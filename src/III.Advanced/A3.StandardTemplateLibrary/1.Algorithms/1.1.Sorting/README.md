Sorting is one of the most basic functions applied to data. It means arranging the data in a particular fashion, which can be increasing or decreasing. There is a builtin function in C++ STL by the name of sort().
This function internally uses IntroSort. In more details it is implemented using hybrid of QuickSort, HeapSort and InsertionSort.By default, it uses QuickSort but if QuickSort is doing unfair partitioning and taking more than N\*logN time, it switches to HeapSort and when the array size becomes really small, it switches to InsertionSort.
