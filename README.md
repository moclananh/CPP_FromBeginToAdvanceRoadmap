# C/C++ Roadmap: From Basic to Advanced

## Project Summary
This roadmap outlines a comprehensive learning journey in C/C++, guiding you from the basics to advanced topics. By following this roadmap, you'll acquire the necessary skills to develop and manage C/C++ projects effectively.

## Basic Level
1. **Introduction to C/C++**
   - Setting up the development environment (IDE and compilers)
   - Basic syntax and structure
   - Data types, variables, and constants
   - Input and output operations
   - Operators (arithmetic, relational, logical)

2. **Control Structures**
   - Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
   - Looping constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)

3. **Functions**
   - Defining and calling functions
   - Function parameters and return types
   - Recursion

4. **Arrays and Strings**
   - One-dimensional and multidimensional arrays
   - String handling functions

## Intermediate Level
5. **Pointers and Memory Management**
   - Introduction to pointers
   - Pointer arithmetic
   - Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`)

6. **Structures and Unions**
   - Defining and using structures
   - Nested structures
   - Unions

7. **File Handling**
   - Reading from and writing to files
   - File operations (`fopen`, `fclose`, `fread`, `fwrite`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`)

8. **Standard Template Library (STL) - C++**
   - Introduction to STL
   - Containers (vectors, lists, sets, maps)
   - Algorithms (sorting, searching)
   - Iterators

## Advanced Level
9. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - C++**
   - Classes and objects
   - Constructors and destructors
   - Inheritance and polymorphism
   - Encapsulation and abstraction

10. **Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms**
    - Linked lists, stacks, queues
    - Trees (binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees)
    - Graphs and graph algorithms
    - Sorting and searching algorithms

11. **Multithreading and Concurrency**
    - Introduction to multithreading
    - Creating and managing threads
    - Synchronization mechanisms (mutexes, semaphores)

12. **Network Programming**
    - Sockets and socket programming
    - Client-server architecture
    - HTTP protocol and web sockets

13. **Best Practices and Design Patterns**
    - Code optimization techniques
    - Common design patterns (singleton, factory, observer)
    - Debugging and profiling tools

## Final Project
- Apply the learned concepts to develop a full-fledged application.
- Example project: A file sharing system with a graphical user interface, incorporating network communication, multithreading, and advanced data structures.

## Supporting Materials
- **Books and Tutorials**:
  - *The C Programming Language* by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie
  - *Effective C++* by Scott Meyers
  - Online courses and tutorials from platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and YouTube.

- **Tools and Resources**:
  - IDEs: Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, CLion
  - Compilers: GCC, Clang, MSVC
  - Debuggers: GDB, LLDB
  - Version Control: Git, GitHub
